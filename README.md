Spire
=====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SCIInstitute/spire.png)](https://travis-ci.org/SCIInstitute/spire)

Built as the primary renderer for SCIRun5, Spire is evolving into a thin
interface to desktop OpenGL 2.0+ and OpenGL ES 2.0+.

Spire is pre-alpha software and its interface is still in flux. It
is not recommended that you use it until release 1.0.0.
